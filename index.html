      <h1>Quiz In The Console</h1>
    </header>
    <p>This project is developed as part of a coding challenge. The challenge is to create a quiz game that works in the developer console. The quiz asks a random question picked from pre-defined list of questions, prints to the console and seeks answer through browser prompt. Once an answer is entered the code validates it against the correct answer. If user's answer is correct user's score starts counting up or else it stays the same.</p>
